# SOLITAIRE_final-project-cs230
For my final project in Data Structures, I worked with a team of two other students to create the game Solitaire. 
I am continuing to add features to the game, and to polish existing elements of the game. 
Please feel free to give me feedback, or to make any contributions that you see fit!
